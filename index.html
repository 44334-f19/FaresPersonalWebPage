    <p>Hello! My name is Lindsey, but most (if not all) of my friends call me Lyn! I am currently a senior and will graduate in Spring of 2021 with a degree in Interactive Digital Media: Computer Science Programming. I also have a minor in Spanish. In addition to Web Development II, I am taking:</p>

    <h2>Summer Activities</h2>
    <p>I didn't do much this summer aside from working at Hyvee as a deli clerk. I actually got that job this summer after being a cashier for two years at the same Hyvee location. It's definitely a change from my previous position, but I like it! When I wasn't at work, I usually was playing computer games or talking with my boyfriend.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Job Experience</h2>
    <p>The only other jobs I've ever worked aside from my cashiering and deli clerk jobs at Hyvee are in food service. I was a host at Applebee's for a short 3 months and I currently work as a carhop at the Sonic here in town.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I have a lot of things I like to do! I draw a LOT (there are a ton of doodles in my notebooks and I have almost 2 binders full of old art).<br><br>I also play the flute. I've known how to play for 13 years and I've done marching band for 9 years (4 years in high school and 5 years here at Northwest). The picture at the top of the page was taken just after the Hughes Field House grand opening last year!<br><br>I also love to sing, but I'm very shy about my own voice. In addition to liking to sing, I love to participate in theater. I was either on stage or part of the tech crew every single year for my high school's theater department.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Specifically Art</h2>
    <p>In Web Development I, I made a website for my artwork. On that website, I linked visitors to all of the places I was active. Those links can be found below along with my username of each webpage.</p>
